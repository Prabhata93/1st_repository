1. What do you know about Linux?
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems. It’s known for stability, security, and flexibility.

2. What are the different Linux operating systems?
Popular distros: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Arch Linux, SUSE, Kali, etc.

3. How to find error logs?
Usually in /var/log/, e.g., /var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages, /var/log/dmesg, /var/log/auth.log.

4. What is the use of sudo command?
Runs commands as another user (mostly root) with proper privileges.

5. Why use ps command?
To display currently running processes and their details.

6. How do you check grep command?
grep "pattern" filename → searches for text patterns inside files.

7. Difference between su and sudo.

su: switch user, requires root password.

sudo: execute single command as root, requires current user’s password (if allowed).

8. How to check disk usage of a directory?
du -sh /path/to/dir

9. What does df -h and du -sh show?

df -h: shows free/used space on all mounted filesystems.

du -sh: shows disk usage of a specific directory.

10. How to find top 10 CPU-consuming processes?
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem --sort=-%cpu | head -n 11

11. What’s the difference between ps aux and top?

ps aux: snapshot of running processes at one moment.

top: dynamic, real-time view of processes.

12. How to kill a process by name or PID?

By PID: kill -9 <pid>

By name: pkill processname

13. How to check which port a process is listening on?
netstat -tulnp or ss -tulnp

14. Explain difference between absolute and relative paths.

Absolute: full path from root / (e.g., /home/user/file.txt).

Relative: path relative to current working directory (e.g., ../file.txt).

15. How to search for a string inside files? (grep)
grep "string" file.txt or recursive: grep -r "string" /path

16. How to check last 50 lines of a log file and keep watching updates?
tail -n 50 -f logfile.log
